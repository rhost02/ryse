# Ryse
You have just been crowned as King of Ryse after the fall of the previous ruler. The prosperity of the kingdom now rests in you. However, your leadership are to be tested first for the next 60 days. Whatever decision you make will have an impact in the kingdom. If you succeeded until the end of the trial, you will be the new ruler of the people. If you, however, failed to bring fortune to the kingdom, your ruling over Ryse will come to an end by a new king.


In each level, the player is in a dilemma with two decisions to make. Each decision taken will gravely increase or decrease certain factors. There are five factors to look out for: Welfare, Resources, Military, Politics and Geography. The player's objective is to rule for 60 days without letting a single factor drop to 0.
